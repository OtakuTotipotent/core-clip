# Core Clip

> An AI Content Generation Web Platform

## Why

``` markdown
1. Modern platforms for content generation lack stable AI models
2. A lot of websites don't give enough access to users in context of content editing
3. AI content generation needs to be fine tuned with user's tastes & preferences
4. AI models must not be allowed to leak users privacy
5. The platforms should provide any content without bypassing local laws & policies
```
